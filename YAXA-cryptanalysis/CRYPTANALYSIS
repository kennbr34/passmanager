Cryptanalsysis has revealed several flaws

1. The keystream derived is not sufficiently random. Statistical testing with dieharder shows that it fails most staistical tests.
2. The keytream becomes periodic after only 3.4 MB of data. However this is equal to more than 3331 password entires.
3. The cipher uses extremly simple relations and relies on the strength of a one-time-pad for good security.
4. The keystream is nowhere close to a one-time-pad because the data is not even indistinguishable from pseudo-randomnes even if non-periodic.
